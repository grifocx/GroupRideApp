## Technical Approach

### Responsive Design Strategy
- Use mobile-first design approach
- Leverage Tailwind's responsive utilities consistently
- Implement custom breakpoints only when necessary
- Use relative units (rem, em) instead of pixels

### Component-specific Strategies

#### NavBar
- Implement collapsible menu for mobile
- Reduce menu items and use icons where appropriate
- Ensure touch targets are at least 44px Ã— 44px

#### MapComponent
- Use Leaflet's mobile-specific controls
- Implement fullscreen toggle for better map viewing
- Add touch-friendly markers with larger hit areas
- Optimize map tiles loading for mobile

#### Forms
- Stack form fields vertically on mobile
- Use full-width inputs on small screens
- Implement larger touch targets for checkboxes/radios
- Ensure proper spacing for touch accuracy

#### Tables
- Implement responsive table patterns:
  - Horizontal scrolling for wide tables
  - Card-based layout for small screens
  - Priority columns that remain visible
  - Collapsible rows for detailed information

#### Calendar
- Simplify calendar view for mobile
- Use swipe gestures for navigation
- Ensure adequate touch targets for date selection
- Optimize event display for small screens

### Testing Methodology
- Develop using Chrome DevTools mobile emulation
- Test on physical devices at regular intervals
- Use Lighthouse for performance metrics
- Implement user testing with mobile-specific scenarios

## Success Metrics
- 25% improvement in mobile page load times
- 40% reduction in mobile bounce rate
- 30% increase in mobile session duration
